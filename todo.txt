A (2024-09-18) : for the very last subsection (on Whittaker models in the case of SL(2)), are we checking the Proposition about the Kostant section, or using it to calculate Wh(\pi)? If it's the first, then we probably need some argument to explain why Wh(\pi) is what we wrote. If it's the second, then what's written is enough (up to a permutation of sentences).
