(For Alexandre:)

1) Write a small section about discrete series: HC parameter, W_K, and notion of large Weyl chamber

2) Go over the section which spells out Sekiguchi (5.3.1), insert the appropriate *s and check the formulas

3)  Fix the beginning of Section 3.5.2 to see if everything now fits together

4) Once everything about Sekiguchi seems OK, fix

5) Isolate the result about Whittaker VS chamber of the HC parameter in a very short section

6) Go over Jeff's recent changes and do some tinkering
