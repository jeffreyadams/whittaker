Let $G(\R)$ be a real reductive group. 
Suppose $\pi$ is an irreducible representation of $G(\R)$ having a Whittaker model, 
and consider three invariants of $\pi$ related to nilpotents elements of the Lie algebra of~$G$ (or its dual): 
the associated variety, the wave-front set, and the set of Whittaker data for which $\pi$ has a Whittaker model. 
If pi is a discrete series representation, these invariants are known to determine each other. 
We provide a self-contained account of this and related results,
including an elementary proof that passage from~$\pi$ to the three invariants defines natural bijections between 
the generic discrete series in an $L$-packet, the possible Whittaker data for $G(\R)$, and the appropriate sets of nilpotent orbits. 
Given one of the three invariants, we also explain how to reconstruct the other two. 
Many of the results were known: we give simplified proofs for several of them, 
for instance a simple proof (for generic discrete series) that the associated variety and the wave-front set 
are related by the Kostant--Sekiguchi correspondence.
